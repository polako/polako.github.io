Performance of web applications is an under-explored topic by developers and academic work in Brazil. However, the access speed to pages is directly related to the user experience and, therefore, reflects directly the revenue from E-Commerces. This research presents an evaluation of performance of the 29 most accessed virtual stores in Brazil according to the Alexa ranking. There is a wide difference between the best and the worst placed. Moreover, the numbers show that the pages of Brazilian e-commerces, with few exceptions, are worse than the amounts considered appropriate by experts and / or global averages.
